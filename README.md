#### Description
Created for the first quarterly project in Chemistry, this program quickly turns letters into periodic table element-styled blocks.

Also an "extras" project under my blog, [TheHomeworkLife](http://www.thehomeworklife.co.nf) ([GitHub](https://github.com/jlam55555/the-homework-life)).

#### Features
- Converts any letter to elements
    - To account for "q" and "j", fictional elements "Unoctquadium" and "Jelementium" are used, respectively
- Automatically detects letters that go together in a symbol: e.g. inputting "Au" will not be <code>A<strike>l</strike> + U</code>, but rather <code>Au</code>
- Type "+" for a new line
- Colorful, clean, and easy-to-use interface
- Easy printing
